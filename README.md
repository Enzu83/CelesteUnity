# CelesteUnity
 
Making Celeste as a first project on Unity (don't expect much)
\
My objective is to make Forsaken City entirely.
I think I'm close to make it because I have finished all the mechanics of the level and made screen transitions.
I need to build the level design and I'm done for !!!

### So far...
- Basic Movement
- Dash
- Wavedash
- Wallbounce
- Climb
- Stamina
- Slide
- Neutral Jump
- Killed when squished
- Death Animation
- Respawn / Spawnpoints
- Dash Crystal
- Strawberry
- Spikes
- Spring
- Collapsing Platform
- Moving Rail Platform
- One Way Platform
- Screen Transitions
- Winged Strawberry


## To do list

- Make all the screens of Forsaken City - 6/37


## Side notes

The concept of the game is not mine, so are also the sounds and the images.
